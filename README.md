# Adidas-Project
A CareerFoundry self directed project utilizing an Adidas US Sales dataset from Kaggle.  Data cleaning, wrangling, and EDA were performed within Python and Excel.  Storyboard, Visualizations, and Dashboards were created via Tableau.

## Objective:
To perform Exploratory Visual, Regression, Cluster and Time Series Analysis on Adidas sales data.  The goal is to provide the marketing team with data regarding Adidas' product sales based on Sales Method, Region, Retailer, and Type of Product.  Ideally, we can find key traits that result in higher income and profit - and try to implement them to products not doing as well.

## Data:
The dataset contained 9,652 Rows and 14 columns.  This included information such as Region, State, City, Total Sales, Operating Profit, et cetera.  The dataset is fairly up to date on Kaggle, but note that the content only contains entries for the years of 2020 - 2021.
